# Kata List

## EASY KATAS IN 5~10min

katas below must be finished in less than 10min

the most ideal time cost is 5min

1. triBasicSorts
    1. a private swap function of integers(implement with bitwise operation)
    2. a reusable unit test for all triple functions
    3. you can use the given random generator
    4. you must write the time complexity and the space complexity of the function you implement
    5. you must write the stability of the function you implement
2. findTwoNumbersFromArray
    1. question: there are only two different numbers which appear odd times among the given array,
       while others appear even times
       you must find them in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
